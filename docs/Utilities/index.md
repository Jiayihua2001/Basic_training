This section provides essential tools and scripts to support your workflow in materials simulation and analysis. It includes:

-  **GIMS** automation platform for FHI-aims.
-  **Visualization tools** to inspect molecular and crystal structures.
-  **Python packages** for structure manipulation, DFT setup, and post-processing.

## GIMS

[The Graphical Interface for Materials Simulation (GIMS)](https://gims.ms1p.org/static/index.html#) is a web-based platform designed to simplify and automate common tasks for FHI-aims in computational materials science. It provides an intuitive user interface for:

- Building crystal structures from scratch or importing from databases.

- Generating input files for various electronic structure codes, including control.in for FHI-aims.

- Post-processing simulation results, such as band structures and density of states (DOS), with built-in visualization tools.

GIMS is particularly useful for new users who want to avoid manual setup, as well as experienced researchers aiming to accelerate workflow efficiency.

##  Visualization Tools

These tools are useful for visualizing molecules and periodic crystal structures during or after DFT or MD simulations.

### ðŸ”¹ [Jmol](http://jmol.sourceforge.net/)
- Java-based interactive viewer for molecules and crystals.
- Supports `.xyz`, `.cif`,`.in`, and many other file formats.
- Ideal for quick viewing of geometries and orbitals.

### ðŸ”¹ [OVITO](https://www.ovito.org/)
- Open Visualization Tool for atomistic simulations.
- Especially suited for periodic systems and MD trajectories.
- Supports `.xyz`, `.cfg`, `.lammps`,`.in` and more.
- Offers scripting via Python for analysis and animations.



##  Python Libraries for Materials Analysis

### ðŸ”¸ [ASE (Atomic Simulation Environment)](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/)
- Build, manipulate, and visualize atoms and molecules.
- Interfaces with most DFT codes (e.g., GPAW, VASP, FHI-aims).
- Good for scripting calculations and automating workflows.

```bash
pip install ase
````

### ðŸ”¸ [pymatgen (Python Materials Genomics)](https://pymatgen.org/)

* Rich toolkit for parsing, analyzing, and generating structures.
* Developed by the Materials Project.
* Excellent `.cif`, `.vasp`, `.poscar` support.

```bash
pip install pymatgen
```
